**This is a personal blog. The content expressed herein represents my own opinion and not that of my employer.**

As you can probably tell by the content of this blog, I work as a software developer, and am based in the north-east of England. My current position is Senior Programmer for [Epic Games](https://epicgames.com), working on services which support content distribution on the Epic Games Store. Although I'm technically affiliated with Epic's Newcastle office, I've been working full-time at home since the pandemic hit in 2020.

I have two bachelors degrees with honours. The first is in Chemistry from [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk), and more recently, I obtained 1st class honours in Computing from the [Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk).  And because I’m a glutton for punishment, I’m also currently studying towards a masters in Software Development, again with the Open University.

I’m proud to be a professional member of [BCS](https://www.bcs.org), the Chartered Institute for IT in the United Kingdom.

Key skills include:

* Back-end service development using Java.
* Use of Amazon Web Services (AWS), e.g. S3, Lambda, CloudFront, SQS, and AppConfig.
* Client application development using C++.
* All things C#.
* Automating deployment pipelines using CI/CD systems and custom code.

I also dabble in a bunch of other stuff too (some of it “just for fun”):

* Nodejs app development.
* Python.

Things I’m keen to learn in the next 12 – 24 months:

* Getting up to speed on the latest version(s) of the JDK.
* Developing in Go … I’ve heard great things about this.

The majority of blogging content will be technical in nature, but be warned… there will be topics of a non-technical nature thrown in from time to time too.

I’m also using Mastodon for short updates. My Mastodon handle is [@yeurch@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@yeurch).  And on Sunday nights (20:00 UK time) I sometimes stream video games on Twitch, at [https://twitch.tv/yeurch](https://twitch.tv/yeurch).  Come say hi!
