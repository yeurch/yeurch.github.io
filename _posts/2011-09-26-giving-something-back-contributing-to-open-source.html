<p>For years and years, I&rsquo;ve used open source applications and libraries. The more I used, the more I felt guilty for taking advantage of other people&rsquo;s hard work. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m alone in feeling that, but for years I&rsquo;ve wanted to give something back, and for some reason, never got round to it. I was thoroughly ashamed of myself. I&rsquo;m a reasonably competent developer, and it was well within my power to do something about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used may different products: NuGet, Orchard, log4net, Cassandra, ELMAH, Glimpse, Ninject, Castle Windsor, jQuery, Modernizr, WordPress, Rhino Mocks. I could <strike>probably</strike> easily go on and list a hundred or so, but that&rsquo;s not the point really.</p>
<p>At last, I&rsquo;ve done it. Last week, I submitted a <a href="http://nugetdocs.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/Forks/yeurch/FixGallerySetup/contribution/1527">pull request</a> to the <a href="http://nugetdocs.codeplex.com">NuGet Docs</a> project on CodePlex. It wasn&rsquo;t a big change, it wasn&rsquo;t even &ldquo;real&rdquo; code, just some fixes to the installation instructions for setting up a local copy of the <a href="http://nuget.org">NuGet gallery</a>. It was accepted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now started one very small step down the road to giving back. I intend to do lots more. If you use open source products, and you have the skills to contribute, I strongly urge you to do so. Thanks.</p>
