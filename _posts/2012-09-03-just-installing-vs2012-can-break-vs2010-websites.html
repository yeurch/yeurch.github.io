title: Just Installing VS2012 Can Break VS2010 Websites

<p>Last week, I installed Visual Studio 2012, to play around with new features. We're probably not ready to move our production code to VS2012 yet, but I just wanted to see what's new. I should probably have installed it in a virtual machine, but hey, this is a well tested, production ready Microsoft product ... what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>Well, nothing went wrong. Until today.</p>
<p>I opened a Visual Studio 2010 solution which <b>has never even been opened in VS2012</b> and it won't build.</p>
<p>The offending piece of code is when we have a <b>website project</b> (web application projects are unaffected), which contains a <code>table</code> element with <code>runat="server"</code>, and the table contains a <code>tbody</code> element.  See the following code for an example.</p>

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head><title>Test</title></head>
<body>
    <form id="form1">
        <div>
            <table id="tbl1">
                <tbody><tr><td>Boo!</td></tr></tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>A machine without VS2012 installed will build and run this without any complaints.  A machine with VS2012 installed will produce the following error message while building:</p>
<p><code>Value of type 'System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlGenericControl' cannot be converted to 'System.Web.UI.HtmlControls.HtmlTableRow'.</code></p>
<p>This is a pretty major breaking change, and it's left me in a situation where I can't build one of our core products. I can't believe that this wasn't picked up given Microsoft's focus on quality and the range of automated testing which is carried out.  Moreover, I just can't understand <b>how</b> installing VS2012 should break a VS2010 solution.</p>
<p>Further, I discovered that running <code>MSBuild</code> from the Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt succeeds on the solution file for the website, but then attempting to run the resulting compiled website with IISExpress yields a 500 Internal Server Error.</p>
<p>What's going on Microsoft?!</p>
