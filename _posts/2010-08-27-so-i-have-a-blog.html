title: So&hellip; I have a Blog

<p>Rather than do anything outlandish for my first post, I thought I&rsquo;d do what the majority of bloggers seem to do for their first post, and that&rsquo;s write a post about why I&rsquo;m blogging.&nbsp; What, you don&rsquo;t believe me? Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2003/02/15/2471.aspx" target="_blank">ScottGu&rsquo;s Blog</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WellItsUpnbspAfterScrewingWithFTPPermissionsOnAndOffForAWeekMyWeblogIsUpnbspSighImBloggingnb.aspx" target="_blank">Hanselman.com</a></p>
<p>I sample a random selection of around ten blogs, and six of those had a first post about blogging.</p>
<p>Anyway, what are my reasons for writing this.&nbsp; Well, a couple of things really. I think the main reason is so that I can look back in years to come and see what I was doing at the time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find that quite amusing.</p>
<p>The other reason is to help people.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a software developer (mainly C#, ASP.NET and SQL Server), and I spend a fair bit of time searching for solutions to problems on the Internet.&nbsp; The accuracy and legitimacy of what I find varies greatly, and sometimes I have to go to a few different places to get the full story.&nbsp; When this happens, I want to write about it, so that others can see my post and gain something from it.&nbsp; So, yes, this is going to be a mainly technical blog, but I will throw in a few bits and pieces of other stuff from time to time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll warn you all though, I&rsquo;m not a great writer, so please forgive me for any clumsiness and the odd piece of rubbish that you&rsquo;ll see posted here from time to time.</p>
