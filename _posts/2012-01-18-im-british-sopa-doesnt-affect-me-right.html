<p><strong><font size="4">Wrong!</font></strong></p>
<p>The wording of the proposed SOPA legislation means that a huge number of websites can be classed as "<em>facilitating the commission</em> of copyright infringement".&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blog which allows users to post comments</li>
<li>An e-commerce site which allows shoppers to leave reviews</li>
<li>Any other site which allows Internet users to upload content which could include copyrighted material</li>
</ul>
<p>But, I'm not subject to US jurisdiction&hellip; there's nothing they can do, right?</p>
<p><strong>Wrong!</strong></p>
<p>If your site is classed as facilitating the commission of copyright infringement, the proposed legislation will allow the US government to force:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISPs to block access to your site in the USA (section 102(c)(2)(A)(i)) &ndash; no big deal for a UK-based small business I agree</li>
<li>Search engines (e.g. Google) to remove you from their listings (section 102(c)(2)(B) &ndash; hmm, that's going to cause a problem</li>
<li>Ad providers (e.g. Google AdSense) from serving ads to your site &ndash; that could hurt my pocket a bit</li>
<li>Payment providers (e.g. PayPal) to terminate service to your site &ndash; ouch, I can't sell anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can appeal against being cut off like this and can be granted a stay of execution, but only if you <em>subject yourself to the jurisdiction of the US courts</em>, and if you know about the action against you (<em>and the legislation does not even require that you're notified!</em>)</p>
<p>This is a really big deal for users of the Internet across the whole world.&nbsp; Even if you're a small cottage industry selling arts and crafts to UK citizens from a site hosted in the UK with a .co.uk web address, the chances are that a lot of your visitors will be referred by Google, and that you'll use a US based payment provider such as PayPal.&nbsp; The US government would therefore be able to effectively shut down your website.</p>
<p>Don't allow this to happen.&nbsp; As non-Americans, we have no congressman to lobby, but you can sign up to this <a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/page/signup/state-dept-petition">petition to the US state department</a>.</p>
<p>Oppose SOPA.</p>
<p>The current text of the proposed SOPA bill can be viewed in its <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3261:">entirity here</a>. My information above is all taken from section 102.</p>
